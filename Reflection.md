# Reflection

## Overview
The **WanderSync project** proved to be an enlightening and rewarding experience for our team, blending technical challenges with collaborative problem-solving to create a practical travel management system.


### Group Contributions
---
Our team worked cohesively to divide tasks and tackle different components of the application. Each member brought unique strengths to the table.

**Frontend Design**:
- Some members focused on designing an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- For example, they developed features like the **welcome screen**, **navigation bar**, and **placeholder screens** in Sprint 1, ensuring seamless navigation between screens like destinations, accommodations, and logistics.

**Backend Development**:
- Another subgroup worked on integrating the app with Firebase, including setting up the **FirebaseDatabaseManager** class with methods such as **addNotetoGroup** and **getDiningReservations** that created databases and added and pulled data from firebase.
- They ensured secure data storage, created structured schemas, and linked related entities like users, groups, destinations, and accommodations for real-time synchronization.

**Feature Implementation**:
- Each member independently developed and tested specific app functionalities, sharing progress during team meetings to maintain alignment.

**Research and Problem-Solving**:
- When encountering challenges, team members took on individual research tasks, exploring documentation or debugging issues.
- Collective brainstorming sessions allowed the group to find solutions efficiently.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Technical hurdles**: Implementing real-time data synchronization and designing Firebase databases to support seamless interaction between users and their data was complex. Restricting data visibility to specific users and groups, required careful consideration.
- **Time constraints**: Balancing the project's demands with academic responsibilities tested our time management skills.

### Knowledge Gained
The project significantly enhanced our technical and collaborative skills:
- **Technical skills**: Working with Firebase, MVVM architecture, design pattern, unit tests and advanced Android studio features deepened our understanding of mobile app development, agile methodologies, and general software development as well.
- **Problem-solving**: Debugging and optimizing the application's features reinforced our ability to break down complex problems into manageable tasks.
- **Team collaboration**: The project underscored the importance of clear communication, task delegation, and mutual support to deliver a cohesive product.

### Final Thoughts
The WanderSync project was not only a technical achievement but also a personal growth experience for everyone involved. It was rewarding to see our ideas transform into a fully functional application that can assist users in organizing and sharing their travel plans in real-time. The project provided ample opportunities to strengthen our development skills, deepen our understanding of real-time app architecture, and work collaboratively in a team environment.

Looking forward, the experience from WanderSync will undoubtedly serve as a foundation for future projects, where we can continue to refine our skills and apply the lessons learned to create even more sophisticated, user-friendly applications. The journey from concept to execution was filled with challenges, but these obstacles made the final product all the more satisfying.
