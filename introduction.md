        <p>Welcome to Wanderly — a project designed to simplify the process of creating and managing travel itineraries for both &#129465; solo and &#128111; group travel. This innovative app allows users to contribute to and refine travel plans in &#9203; real-time.</p>

        <p class="start">Wanderly allows users to organize locations, transportation options, accommodations, dining reservations, and create personal notes. Users first create a secure account to manage their itineraries. They can then invite friends, family, or colleagues to join their travel group and collaborate on the itinerary.</p>
        <p class="start"> Some key features of Wanderly include the ability to add family members and friends to your trip. On the logistics page, you can add a personalized note to your travel destination. You can also use our smart fill-in algorithm to calculate how many days you've planned a trip.</p>
        <!-- <p class="start">Ready to start planning your next adventure? Sign up for Wanderly today!</p> -->
        <p class="start">Wanderly was developed with two primary objectives in mind. First, to foster effective team collaboration by working together to create a product that meets specific requirements. Second, to enhance our software engineering skills by utilizing modern technologies, adhering to GRASP and SOLID principles, and employing comprehensive documentation techniques.</p>
