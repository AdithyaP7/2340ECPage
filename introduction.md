# Introduction

## CS 2340 Sprint 4: Travel Community

Welcome to **WanderSync: A Collaborative Travel Management System** â€” a project designed to simplify the process of creating and managing travel itineraries for both solo and group travel. This innovative app allows users to contribute to and refine travel plans in real-time.

### Background

Through **WanderSync**, users can:
- Organize locations, transportation options, accommodations, dining reservations, and personal notes.
- Securely create accounts to manage their itineraries.
- Leverage a user-friendly interface for seamless itinerary management.
- Collaborate with group members in real-time to synchronize travel details and updates.

#### Key Features
- **Integration of travel details**: Manage destinations, transportation schedules, lodging information, and dining preferences.
- **Collaboration tools**: Add and share notes, create shared travel agendas, and synchronize updates among all group members.

The project is implemented across four sprints, with specific requirements for each.

### Purpose

This project has two primary goals:
1. **Team Collaboration**: Gain experience working collaboratively to develop a product that meets specific requirements.
2. **Software Engineering Skills**: Improve skills with modern technologies, key software engineering principles, and documentation techniques.

Throughout the project:
- We learned to document analysis and design using standard techniques.
- We learned to test occur alongside development, requiring the creation of unit tests to verify implementation functionality.

With each sprint, our aptitude in software engineering concepts grew, preparing us to apply these principles in future projects.
